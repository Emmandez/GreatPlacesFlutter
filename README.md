## About

The aim of this project is to learn how to work with device features such as local storage, camera and location.

The user can add a new place which is stored in the phone memory using SQLite.
When creating a new place, the user can take a picture directly from the app.
They also can choose between using their current location or selecting a location on the map.

Google services are used for the map feature.
